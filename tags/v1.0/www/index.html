		<h1>NCron – .NET scheduling service</h1>

		<p>
			NCron is a task scheduling service, written completely in managed C#. The service will execute tasks written in any .NET-language, in a (almost) any possible time pattern.
		</p>
		
		<h2>History</h2>
		
		<p>
		  The NCron project is a spin-off from the <a href="http://whistleblower.sourceforge.net/">Whistleblower</a> project. As a system monitoring framework, Whistleblower needs to do a lot of task scheduling, and when the scheduling logic started to grow, it seemed like a good idea to split up the project.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  As of now, both NCron and Whistleblower is maintained by one lone developer, <a href="http://malamute.dk/">Jørn Schou-Rode</a> of Denmark. Both projects are used by some of Jørn's clients, but the further development is mainly done in his spare time. If you have anything to say or add to the projects, do not hestitate to drop me an <a href="mailto:schou-rode@users.source-forge.net">e-mail</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Usage / distributions</h2>
				
		<p>
		  NCron is packed and distributed for two distinct types of usage:
		</p>
		
		<dl>
		  <dt>Utility library</dt>
		  <dd>
		    The core functionality of NCron is all placed within the NCron.dll assembly, which can be referenced by third-party .NET-projects as they need to schedule some task(s). Amongst a set of model and helper classes, lives the <em>SchedulingService</em> class, which can easily be configured and installed – possibly &ldquo;disguised&rdquo; under the name of the third-party project.
		  </dd>
		  
		  <dt>Stand-alone service</dt>
		  <dd>
		    If you just need a service which will run some of your method(s) in some given time pattern(s), the stand-alone package might be the easiest way to go. Simply install the <em>NCron scheduling service</em>, modify its configuration files, and off you go!
		  </dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h2>Download</h2>

		<p>
		  No binary distributions are yet available for the NCron project, but the estimate is for a first alpha version medio June 2008.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  If you would like to look at – or maybe even test drive – some of the code, you will have to check out the project from the Subversion (SVN) server.
